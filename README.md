# Calculator Project

This is a dynamic calculator project developed as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The goal of this project is to build a functional calculator that handles basic and advanced operations, such as square roots, percentages, and negations, with a focus on user input handling and maintaining a clean user experience.

## Live Demo

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Advanced operations: square roots, percentages, and negation  
- Handles edge cases like nested negations and invalid inputs  
- History tracking of previous calculations with the ability to view and edit history  
- Responsive design for various screen sizes  
- Customizable UI with buttons for specific functions  
- Live updates of calculations as input is provided  
- Made the `%` button act as a percent or modulo operator depending on the expression pattern

- **Floating animation for buttons** when clicked, enhancing user interaction  

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**  

## Future Improvements

- Implement keyboard support for calculations  
- Add more advanced operations (e.g., exponentiation, logarithms)  
- Improve UI/UX with animations and custom styling  
- Refactor and improve code readability
